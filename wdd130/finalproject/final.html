            <h2>Story of the Week</h2>
            <p>Breastfeeding on demand may seem a rigorous job, especially when you have a pile of chores and other
                things to attend to, but I came to feel the joy and bond as I sit to feed my little one. It relaxes my
                body and my soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I discovered upon reading an article in the web, breastfeeding produces the naturally soothing hormones oxytocin and
                prolactin that promote stress reduction and positive feelings in the nursing mother. Increased
                confidence and self-esteem. Increased calmness. Breastfed babies cry less overall, and have fewer
                incidences of childhood illness.-Anonynous
