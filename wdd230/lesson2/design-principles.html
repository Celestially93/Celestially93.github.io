            <p>The photo used by Chevrolet, applied the rule of thirds. The subject are along the points with the nine
                equal lines. Thereby, draw the viewers eyes to the car, in the most natural way.</p>

            <p>I find this webpage's mobile screen view very organized. The contents were all aligned left (except for
                its name), which makes it more user friendly, and sophisticated.</p>

            <p>I love the simple contrast in this webpage. The colors complements each other, and what I like the most is, the
                font style. The texts has the same font style, but the font size and weights makes the contrast more clearer
                without overdoing the design.</p>
