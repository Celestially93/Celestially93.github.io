            <h2>10 Top Business Tips for Starting a Business That Will Succeed</h2>
            <p>By Susan Ward</p>
            <img src="images/btip.jpeg" alt="bulb drawn in a sticky note" width="200">
            <p>Starting a business for the first time and worried about failure? Give your new enterprise the best
                chance of success with these top business tips, the best advice I've collated from other entrepreneurs
                and developed from my own experience of more than 20 years of having "been there and done that" as a
                small business person.<br><br>


                1) Be Passionate
                You don't have to love whatever your business is about (and probably shouldn't), but you do have to be
                fired up about it. You're going to devote a lot of time and energy to starting a business and building
                it into a successful enterprise, so it's really important that you truly deeply enjoy what you do,
                whether it be running fishing charters, creating pottery, or providing financial advice.<br><br>


                2) Start While You Are Still Employed
                How long can most people live without money? Not long. And it may be a long time before your new
                business actually makes any profits. Being employed while you're starting a business means money in your
                pocket while you're going through the start-up process.<br><br>


                3) Don't Do it Alone
                You need a support system while you're starting a business (and afterward). A family member or friend
                that you can bounce ideas off and who will listen sympathetically to the latest business start-up crisis
                is invaluable. Even better, find a mentor or, if you qualify, apply for a business start-up program such
                as the ones provided through Futurpreneur Canada. When you're starting a business experienced guidance
                is the best support system of all.<br><br>

                4) Get Clients or Customers Lined Up
                Don't wait until you've officially started your business to line these up, because your business can't
                survive without them. Do the networking. Make the contacts. Sell or even give away your products or
                services. You can't start marketing too soon.<br><br>

                5) Write a Business Plan
                The main reason for doing a business plan first when you're thinking of starting a business is that it
                can help you avoid sinking your time and money into starting a business that will not succeed.<br><br>

                6) Do Your Research
                You'll do a lot of research writing a business plan, but that's just a start. When you're starting a
                business, you need to become an expert on your industry, products and services if you're not already.
                Joining related industry or professional associations before you start your business is a great idea.<br><br>

            <h2>Writing a Business Plan? Do These 5 Things First</h2>
            <p>By Howard Wen</p>
            <img src="images/bplan.jpeg" alt="notebook and pencil beside a laptop" width="200">
            <p>Are you ready to write a business plan and launch your new company? Follow these five steps to ensure
                your
                business plan is comprehensive.<br><br>
                When you're first getting serious about starting a business, the first thing you should do is write a
                business plan. Business plans serve several key functions that make them indispensable for successfully
                launching a new company. Not only do they serve as a roadmap to guide you in the early days of your
                business, but they also serve as an opportunity to research market conditions, competitors and potential
                pitfalls you might not be aware of.<br><br>

                Business plans are both an analytical and planning tool, two components that are essential for getting a
                new
                business off the ground. This guide offers you key insights into how to create a high-quality business
                plan
                that will serve your business now and in the future.<br><br>

                Editor's note: Looking for information on creating a custom business plan? Use the questionnaire below
                and
                our vendor partners will contact you to provide you with the information you need.<br><br>

                What is a business plan?
                As with most ideas, the best way to execute them is to have a plan. A great idea for a startup isn't
                enough;
                it must be bolstered by a plan of action. [Interested in investing in business plan software or services

                your small business idea? Check out our best picks and product reviews.<br><br>

                A business plan is a written outline that you present to others, such as investors, whom you want to
                recruit
                into your venture. It's your pitch to these people, sharing with them what your startup idea is and how
                you
                expect to make money from it.<br><br>

                Why do I need a business plan?
                Starting a new business comes with headaches. Being prepared for those headaches – and trying to get
                ahead
                of them – can greatly decrease the impact they could have on your business. One important step in
                preparing
                for the challenges your startup may face is writing a solid business plan.<br><br>

                Writing a business plan helps you understand more clearly what you need to do to reach your goals. The
                finished business plan also serves as a reminder to you of these goals. It's a valuable tool that you
                can
                refer back to, helping you stay focused and on track.<br><br>
